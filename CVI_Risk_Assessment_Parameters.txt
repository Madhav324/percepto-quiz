2. Risk factors are summed to determine overall risk level
3. Higher risk factor totals indicate greater CVI risk
4. Thresholds vary by quiz complexity and clinical significance

GENERAL RISK FACTOR ASSIGNMENT:
- Severe deficits: 3-4 risk factors
- Moderate issues: 2-3 risk factors  
- Mild concerns: 1-2 risk factors
- Normal performance: 0 risk factors

RISK LEVEL DETERMINATION:
- HIGH RISK: Typically 6-9+ total risk factors (varies by quiz)
- MEDIUM RISK: Typically 4-8 total risk factors (varies by quiz)
- LOW RISK: Typically 0-5 total risk factors (varies by quiz)

==============================================

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
==================================

CRITICAL CVI INDICATORS:
1. Mirror Fixation Assessment - Primary screening tool
2. Visual Neglect Assessments - Hemispatial attention deficits
3. Figure Ground Assessment - Complex visual processing

SECONDARY INDICATORS:
1. Visual Closure tasks - Visual completion abilities
2. Form Constancy assessments - Object recognition stability
3. Spatial processing tasks - 3D visual awareness

SUPPORTING ASSESSMENTS:
1. Visual Memory tasks - Visual information retention
2. Sequential Memory tasks - Ordered visual processing
3. Motion Perception - Dynamic visual processing
4. Visual Discrimination - Pattern differentiation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- HIGH RISK: Immediate referral for comprehensive CVI evaluation
- MEDIUM RISK: Monitor closely, consider follow-up assessment
- LOW RISK: Normal visual processing, routine monitoring
